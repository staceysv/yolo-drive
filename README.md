# W&B Example: Logging 2D bounding boxes

This repo loads a pretrained YOLOv3 model to draw 2D bounding boxes on dashboard photos of driving scenes.
Code follows [this example](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/) and this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/lavanyashukla01/yolov3-lyft-dataset/).

## Running the code

`python train.py -p` to use the pretrained model
